### Customizations
You can customize the installation either by adding optional available features or by specifying own installation configuration file.

#### Adding optional features
Optional features (Sql tools, phone tools, etc.) are available but not installed by default.
You can provide optional parameters to include them during the install.
Here is example that includes the Sql Tools and Windows Phone Emulators:

    choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -packageParameters "--Features SQL,WindowsPhone81Emulators"

##### Available features:
- LightSwitch
- MDDCPlusPlus
- MDDJS
- OfficeDeveloperTools
- SilverLight_Developer_Kit
- SQL
- ToolsForWin81_WP80_WP81
- VC_MFC_Libraries
- WindowsPhone81Emulators

#### Using own configuration file
Specifying the optional features above modifies the configuration file used during installation (AdminDeployment.xml). If that is not enough you can provide this file on your own.
Example:

    choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile c:\path to your\AdminDeployment.xml"
    choco install VisualStudio2015Enterprise -packageParameters "--AdminFile http://path/to/your/AdminDeployment.xml"
